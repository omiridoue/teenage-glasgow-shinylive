#Shiny apps are broken in two components one for user interface, ui, and one for the server.
#A few comments on the user interface, there are several structures you can go with, 
#this one has a sidepanel and mainpage. You would nest these components in the 'fluidPage'
#Shiny can take code that would normally pair well with HTML pages called css, the purpose
#for this is to change font, background color etc. and is customisable to your preference.
#the style option can on its own specify the height for ex of the section you're working on
#110vh would stand for vertical height, with 100 referring to the height of a page (anything
#past 100 'overflows' and can be viewed by scrolling. Within the fluidpage you can specify
#what are called fluidRows these store other aspects of the app along horizontal strips, here
#we use radioButtons, pickerInput and sliderInput. The first argument in any of these refers to the name you use to refer to the filter, the second argument is what is actually displayed as a name and the remaining arguments normally refer to the choices if discrete, the value which is a default 'pre-populated' selection, or the max, min for continuous filters. The following code hardcodes these but it's best to have these take after actual variable values. Another feature is the helper functions these offer popup messages with any message you would like to offer to the user, they can be customised in many ways - even embed a full markdown file with graph/images, text or display interactively information about variables observed.

The ideas draw on the R Glasgow Users Group from Nov 2023, special thanks to Dylan Lewis and Erik Igelstr√∂m at the University of Glasgow Social Public Health Unit for showcasing their work and for all the helpful comments and advice from attendees! Most of the code draws on the extensive sigmajs-shiny documentation by John Coene. Data curation in igraph was carried forward from a previous project as part of the NCRM Social Network Analysis course delivered by Dr. Michael Heaney. Generative Artificial Intelligence was used to code aspects of the server side for this shiny document.
